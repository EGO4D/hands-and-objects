# State Change Temporal Localization and Classification Benchmark

This directory contains baseline implementations for State Change Temporal Localization and Classification Benchmark.

## Data Loader

The data loader files are in `i3d-resnet50/datasets` and are developed and maintained by Siddhant Bansal (<a href="https://sid2697.github.io/">https://sid2697.github.io/</a>) at IIIT Hyderabad.

We recommend using the following data loader: https://github.com/EGO4D/hands-and-objects/blob/main/state-change-localization-classification/i3d-resnet50/datasets/StateChangeDetectionAndKeyframeLocalisation.py
